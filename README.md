# Energy_Consumption_Prediction - Time Series Prediction 
Energy Consumption Prediction based on Polynomial Regression and Support Vector Machines 
This is a academic coursework. The research contains findings of energy consumption prediction related to various historic weather factors. Polynomial Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models have been used as data analytics methodologies. This dataset consists of 8 dimensions that are correlated with weather measurements from 36 locations across the UK. Data management, standardization and exploratory data analysis have been discussed and displayed in the report. Five literature reviews about energy consumption and our approaches were included in the report. An explanation on selecting these two data analytics models and their performance evaluation were also included. Finally, a conclusion was made based on the analysis result.
